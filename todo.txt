consider a replication strategy
include access_level in sender obj
Time command param to include both seconds and time_str
adjust default access levels
fix number grouping on linux
auto-clear queue, with a bypass
investigate async/await for events and commands
off/on relay commands between org and private channels
not spam on invalid command
not spam on restart
manually run timer events
